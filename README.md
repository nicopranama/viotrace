# Viotrace â€“ Student Violation Tracker using AVL Tree

**Viotrace** is a console-based student violation tracking system written in C.  
It uses an **AVL Tree** data structure to efficiently store, search, and manage violation data, including automatic drop-out logic when students exceed penalty limits.

- Register students with unique NIM and name
- Record student violations (type, date, points)
- Automatically "drop out" students who exceed 100 violation points
- Move dropped students into a separate "inactive" AVL tree
- View and search both active and inactive students
- Sort violation histories by date
